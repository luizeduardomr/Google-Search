Collection: Live Web Proxy Crawls

Content crawled via the Wayback Machine Live Proxy mostly by the Save Page Now
feature on web.archive.org.  
  
Liveweb proxy is a component of Internet Archives wayback machine project. The
liveweb proxy captures the content of a web page in real time, archives it
into a ARC or WARC file and returns the ARC/WARC record back to the wayback
machine to process. The recorded ARC/WARC file becomes part of the wayback
machine in due course of time.
